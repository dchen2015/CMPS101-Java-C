Lex.java
This java file reads in the input file and convert it into array by reading each line of the file as strings. 
Then it creats a ADT list containing the index of each String sorted in alphabetical order by insersion sort using the compareTo function. 
Lastly, it prints the array in the order of the list into a output file. User will be able to see an alphabetically sorted array of strings expanded vertically (one string per line). 

ListClient.java
This java file helps testing if the List.java functions correctly by having a whole bunch of calculations using the operations provided by List.java, and compare the output with the answer of the ListClient. If matches, that can tell the programmer that the List.java is working correctly.
