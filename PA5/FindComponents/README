List.c
is the advanced array to store objects, in this case, ints. Every single object knows who its previous and next object is. Exactly the same from PA2

List.h
header file for List.c which have all the names of the functions.

Graph.c
a way to store connected vertices (graph). Store vertices in adjacent list that has a array of lists that each list contains all neighbor of ith vertex in array. 
Then offers a special way of organizing this graph called DFS, which is almost a direct translate from the DFS provided in midterm2 but added finished and discovered.

Graph.h
header file for Graph.c which have all the names of the functions.

FindComponents.c
The main program that reads in the connected vertices and calculates the strongly connected components of the graph.
It first transpose the graph and do DFS to every unknown vertices. Then it creats a list of scc for output printing. 

GraphTest.c
A way to test all the special cases of graph to ensure the recorded graph is accurate.
